## A simple HandWritten Recognizer implementation

A LENET-5 architecture neural network that can recognize handwritten digits from a video.

Run `recongizer.py` to get the predictions and it does not actually tell whether the given frame is a number or not but can quite nicely predict the given number.


__The number must be inside the red bounding box.__
